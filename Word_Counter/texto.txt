Proposal for a Public Art Installation in Nova Friburgo

The aim of this proposal is to create a unique and sustainable public art installation, inspired by the Gardens by the Bay in Singapore, to enhance the natural beauty of Nova Friburgo. This project will focus on combining art and nature, featuring large, tree-like structures integrated with local flora and innovative lighting systems.

A current issue that this project will address is the lack of engaging green spaces within the city that promote environmental awareness and tourism. Nova Friburgo, being located in a mountainous region with rich biodiversity, can benefit greatly from a project that highlights ecological preservation while serving as a landmark for locals and tourists alike.

The installation will benefit the community by providing a public space for recreation, relaxation, and education about environmental sustainability. It will also promote tourism, attracting visitors to the city and boosting the local economy.

The proposed piece of public art is a "Vertical Garden Park", consisting of towering, sculptural gardens that light up at night, showcasing the natural beauty of the region. This space will serve as a venue for events, cultural activities, and an ongoing reminder of the importance of protecting our environment.
